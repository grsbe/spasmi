# Mathematical models and algorithms

Spasmi works on an algebraic observation model $b\approx Ax$. Here $A$ is
the sensitivity or design matrix, $b$ the prepared observation vector,
and $x$ the unknown coefficients. The package does not infer units or
construct $A$ from a physical model. If the physical field is $Dx+x_0$,
then coefficient constraints on $x$ are not automatically constraints on
that field.

## Penalized LASSO

The signed problem is

$$
\min_{x\in\mathbb R^n}
F_\lambda(x)
=\frac12\|Ax-b\|_2^2+\lambda\|x\|_1.
$$

The nonnegative variant replaces $\mathbb R^n$ with $\mathbb R_+^n$.
The smooth gradient is $g(x)=A^\top(Ax-b)$, with Lipschitz constant
$L=\|A\|_2^2$. FISTA uses a step $t\leq1/L$ and the proximal update

$$
x_{k+1}
=\operatorname{prox}_{t\lambda\|\cdot\|_1+I_C}
       \bigl(y_k-tg(y_k)\bigr),
\qquad
q_{k+1}=\frac{1+\sqrt{1+4q_k^2}}{2},
\qquad
y_{k+1}=x_{k+1}+\frac{q_k-1}{q_{k+1}}(x_{k+1}-x_k).
$$

For signed coefficients the prox is soft thresholding,
$\operatorname{sign}(v_j)\max(|v_j|-t\lambda,0)$; for nonnegative
coefficients it is $\max(v_j-t\lambda,0)$. This means a coefficient can
be exactly zero, which is the source of sparsity. An estimated
$L$ that is too small can make the step unsafe; the default power
estimate is not a proof that $t\leq1/L$.

The ADMM split $x=z$ instead alternates

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{k+1}&=(A^\top A+\rho I)^{-1}
          \bigl(A^\top b+\rho(z^k-u^k)\bigr),\\
z^{k+1}&=\operatorname{prox}_{(\lambda/\rho)\|\cdot\|_1+I_C}
          (x^{k+1}+u^k),\\
u^{k+1}&=u^k+x^{k+1}-z^{k+1}.
\end{aligned}
$$

The factorization is cached. For $n>m$, the implementation factors
$AA^\top+\rho I$ and uses the Woodbury identity rather than factoring
an $n\times n$ matrix. $\rho$ is fixed for that initialized solver.

## L1-ball-constrained least squares

Here the penalty is replaced by a budget $R$:

$$
\min_x\frac12\|Ax-b\|_2^2
\quad\text{subject to}\quad
\|x\|_1\leq R,\quad
x\in C.
$$

$C$ is the full space or the nonnegative orthant. The FISTA prox
becomes projection onto the feasible L1 ball, not soft thresholding
with a particular $\lambda$. Constrained ADMM uses the same split
idea with that projection as its $z$ step. The radius $R$ and a LASSO
$\lambda$ are different controls; their correspondence is
solution-dependent.

## Sparse plus smooth blocks

For $A\in\mathbb R^{m\times n}$ and $B\in\mathbb R^{m\times p}$, the
block model is

$$
\min_{x,z}\frac12\|Ax+Bz-b\|_2^2
+\lambda\|x\|_1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\|z\|_2^2,
$$

with optional coefficient nonnegativity. The $x$ block is sparse,
whereas the ridge penalty keeps $z$ smooth in coefficient magnitude.
A combined design $[A\ B]$ is built once for the reusable CPU FISTA
workspace. This is not a spatial smoothness constraint unless $B$
and the interpretation of $z$ make it one.

## Spatial regularizers

The squared graph-Laplacian model is

$$
\min_{x\in C}\frac12\|Ax-b\|_2^2
+\lambda\|x\|_1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\|Lx\|_2^2,
$$

where $L$ is the 2D nearest-neighbor graph Laplacian. The
$\|Lx\|_2^2$ term penalizes rapid local changes but can spread a
localized source. FISTA includes $\gamma L^\top Lx$ in the smooth
gradient.

The total-variation model is

$$
\min_{x\in C}\frac12\|Ax-b\|_2^2
+\lambda_1\|x\|_1+\lambda_{\rm TV}\operatorname{TV}(x).
$$

With forward spatial differences $Dx$, isotropic TV sums
$\sqrt{(D_xx)_j^2+(D_yx)_j^2}$ over pixels; anisotropic TV sums
the absolute components. PDHG uses a dual variable for the
nonsmooth TV term rather than squaring it. TV tends to preserve
edges while discouraging isolated local jumps.

## Preparing scientific data

For observations $y$, estimated background $c$, prior field $x_0$,
physical dictionary $D$, and covariance whitening operator $W$,
a typical algebraic preparation is

$$
b=W(y-c-Ax_0),\qquad A_{\rm solve}=WAD.
$$

Then Spasmi solves for coefficients $z$ in
$b\approx A_{\rm solve}z$ and the physical field is $x_0+Dz$.
If the measurement model uses differential observations, apply the
same differencing consistently to both $y$ and $A$. Spasmi does
not decide whether those modeling choices are justified.

Near-collinear columns can yield almost identical $Ax$ from very
different $x$. A solver reaching numerical optimality does not
make the field identifiable. Compare predictions, aggregates,
and solutions under nearby $\lambda$ values.

See [optimality](optimality.md) for the exact stop tests and
[performance](performance.md) for the cost of each algorithmic choice.
